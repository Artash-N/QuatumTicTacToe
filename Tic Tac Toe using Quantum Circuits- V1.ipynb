    "\n",
    "Now that I have initialized the tic tac toe board, I needed to come up with a way to use Quantum Circuits to predict the best move to make based on a given board configuration dictionary (board)\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anything else, the first thing I needed to do was express the Tic Tac Toe board using Qbits. I used Qiskit to create a 9 Qbit circuit. Each Qbit would represent a different position on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I needed to apply Quantum Gates to the circuit in such a way that when measuring the Qbits, the Qbit representing the optimal place to choose in the game would have the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to turn to T Gates to code the rules of winning tic tac toe into my Circuit. T-Gates amplify the probability of a Qbit being measured as 1. The more T-Gates, the higher the probability of measuring 1. So based on how important a rule was, I could assign each Qbit a different number of T-Gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In my function, there are 4 steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Apply a Hadamard Gate to every qubit representing a possible move on the board (No Gates for positions on the board already taken). This put's all the posible moves in superposition, and forces the probability of all non-possible moves to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply 1 T-Gate to every Qubit representing a position on the board with 1 other \"Xs or Os\" in the same row or column (complete 2 in a row, or block). This is to encourage it to start to complete 3 in a row if there is no other better move.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Apply 2 T-Gates to every Qubit representing a position on the board with 2 other \"Xs or Os\" in the same row or clolumn (blocking or winning). This amplifies the probability of choosing a position where it's either completing a row/column and winning, or stoping the other playing from completing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply 3 T-Gates to every qubit representing a position with 2 other \"Xs or Os\" on the same diagonal. (blocking or winning). Completing a diagonal is the strongest move in tic tac toe, so it is assigned the highest number of T-Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the final circuit was created, The Quantum Circuit would be run for 512 shots on the IBM Quantum Simulator. The Qbit that returned the value \"1\" the most number of times would be the most optimal move to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This process would be repeated for each time the Tic-Tac-Toe board was updated. i.e: a new circuit created for every move"
